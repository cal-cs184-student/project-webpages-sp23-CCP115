    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p><i>Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this project. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the project.</i></p>
    <p>
      This project was focused around building a convincing physical simulation of a cloth object, using numerical simulation, as well as various texture mapping techniques.
			<br>First, I created a cloth object represented by a series of masses and springs. By then defining and constraining the relationships and physics between these masses and springs, I created a fairly accurate simulation of how cloth can really behave. This was done using numerical integration, as it is fairly performant and accurate. Coupled with collision detection for spheres, planes, and the cloth itself, the simulation became more convincing. Finally, I learnt about how to use GLSL to write shader programs, and implemented in some texture techniques such as bump mapping, displacement mapping, Blinn-Phong lighting, texture mapping, and environment mapping.
			<br>Overall, I learnt a lot from this project, and feel as if I now better understand a lot of how 3D graphics works in movies and games. The most interesting thing I found from this project was bump mapping, as this was something I always considered to be very impressive. Being able to emulate the effects of light reflecting off of a non-smooth surface, while not actually creating a non-smooth surface always seemed difficult to me. I am now aware of how they do it, and it is not as complex as I once assumed.

  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Unsurprisingly, a low spring constant means a more flexible material. During the falling portion of the simulation, the
    cloth was much bouncier than with a higher spring constant. At the resting position, the folds are visibly smaller, and
    there is a large sag at the top of the cloth.
  </p>
  <p>
    A high spring constant makes the material act stiffer. During the falling portion of the simulation, the cloth didn't
    bounce much. At the rest position visible in the image, there aren't many folds, and even the top of the cloth itself
    doesn't sag much.

  </blockquote>

  <p>
    A very low density shown in the left image looks similar to the high <code>Ks</code> shown above. This makes sense,
    as a less dense material is lighter for a given volume, meaning that there is less weight force dragging the cloth
    downwards.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the high density shown in the right image below, the cloth is very straight. Again, this makes sense as the
    material is much denser, leading to the weight of the cloth pulling itself down to a near straight position.

      <small>
        What about for <code>damping</code>?
      </small>
    </b>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    For the low damping, the falling of the cloth took a long time to settle, and it would wave back and forth for
    multiple oscillations. This makes sense as a lower damping means less energy is dissipated per timestep, so more
    energy can be carried through each swing. The resting position is similar to that of the default damping, but the extra
    oscillations actually cause the top of the cloth to tilt towards the camera, instead of away like it usually does.
  </p>
  <p>
    With a very high damping of 1%, the cloth simply takes a very long time to fall. The screenshot shown was taken even
    whilst the cloth was still falling, simply due to how long it was taking.

  <p>
    As expected, at a lower stiffness, the cloth is softer. It wraps and conforms more to the shape of the sphere, and the edge of the cloth is seen pointing near vertical at the bottom.
		<br> The higher the stiffness, the more the cloth resister conforming to the shape of the sphere. In the image on the right with the highest stiffness, the edges of the cloth are resisting gravity more, and point more upwards at around 45 degrees.

    The ks was left at the default value of 5,000. Modifying the density changes the weight of the cloth. In the left image, the density was set to 5 g/cm^2. This lighter material weighs less, and this is reflected in the way that it doesn't fold down on itself as aggressively. In the right image, the density is set to 45 g/cm^2. We can see the heavier material is much more compacted, and folded up much more, due to the larger weight force it is experiencing.

  </div>

  <p>
    The density was left at the default 15 g/cm^2. In the left image, with a ks of 50, we can see the material is very wrinkled. This makes sense, as the lower spring constant means that the material can bend much more aggressively without rebounding, allowing for all these small wrinkles. Conversely, in the right images with a ks of 50,000, the material is unable to stay folded up into small sections due to the large spring constant making it stiff. As a result, there are only a few folds, with most of the material bouncing back to a straight position. An interesting observation is that the low density material rests in a similar position to the high stiffness material. This makes sense, as both types are discouraged to fold, either because the material itself resists, or there simply isn't much weight force encouraging it to fold.

      Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
    </b>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    A shader is a program that determines the final output colour of a pixel, based on geometric information taken from the 3D scene.
		<br>A vertex shader, as the name implies, works on the vertices of a 3D model. In the code provided in <code>Default.vert</code>, the shader works to simply take in object space vertex information, and transform it to world space. Once this is done, the world space information of the vertex is passed to a fragment shader for further computation.
		</code>The fragment shaders take in the vertex information that was preprocessed by the <code>.vert</code> shader. They then select the final colour for the pixel being drawn to, and this is where you can choose to create different materials and effects depending on what you want.
  </p>

    </b>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The images below are exaggerated to show the effects of each component.
		<br>As you can see, ambient contributes a constant level of shading regardless of light source or surface direction.
		<br>Diffuse is a matte surface reflection that reflects light independent of the view direction, and only accounts for the light direction.
		<br>The specular component is much more specific, and reflects light in a narrower field. This field is roughly where the view direction is aligned with the light direction mirrored in the surface normal. This is essentially how a mirror works, and explains why the highlight only appears on areas of the surface that are essentially a direct reflecting point from the view angle to the light source itself.
		<br> The Blinn-Phong model simply combines all three components together, creating a fairly convincing material. By changing some parameters of the model, you can create materials that are more specular, or more matte in appearance.

    Bump mapping does a good job of capturing the way that light would reflect off of ridges and bumps. However, as is more evident on the sphere, it doesn't hold up to close scrutiny. When comparing the top right image with the bottom right image, it is clear that the bump mapping doesn't actually capture the ridges, but it does a pretty good job of emulating how the light would reflect off of them. In contrast, the displacement textures do show an actual, visible change in the ridges.
		<br>In the bottom left image, we can see that the sphere mesh is fairly coarse. This means that the displacement map is also very rough, and does a poor job of matching the texture. In the bottom right image, with a higher sphere mesh resolution, the ridges match pretty closely with the texture, giving a more accurate displacement map.

  <blockquote>
    <b>
      If you implemented any additional technical features for the cloth simulation,
      clearly describe what you did and provide screenshots that illustrate your work.
      If it is an improvement compared to something already existing on the cloth simulation,
      compare and contrast them both in words and in images.
